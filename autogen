#
# The Glib developers are a bit over-eager in their version requirements, requiring
# an unnecessarily high verison of pkg-config at configure time, when they really
# only need it at autogen time.  This patch resets the version number in the file
# just generated by aclocal to the version we've been requiring all along.
